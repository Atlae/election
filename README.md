# Election.exe
A minimalist meta meme maker for TEP Delegate Elections... because why not?

## Purpose
Every four months, The East Pacific holds delegate elections in which nominees are subjected to the *exhausting* process of creating new memes. Worry no longer! Election.exe has you covered and will generate them for you. The multi-layer neural network operates on the combined power of all of the computers that install it.
